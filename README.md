Compliments are Nice
====================
 
Created for fun.

WTF does this do?
-----------------

Well, we all need a little 'pick me up' from 
time to time so I created this to send a random
SMS message (a 'compliment').

In order to fully utilize this you'll need to 
create a cron job to run process.rb once a day.

Usage
-----

Set up a cron to determine when to excecute process.rb:  

  00 11 * * * /path/to/compliment/bin/process.rb
